# CNC-Router
CNC Router based off of the A4988 and ATmega2560


This board used the ATmega2560 to control 3 steppers, 4 servos, and manage 3 switches! Quite a lot to it! It also has a flex cable for an interface board to provide more user interaction. The board will an Oled, potentiometers and buttons. There's a barrel jack connector for the steppers power and an ftdi chip for serial communication. Got these made from PCBway. Been really happy with the finishes and the prices are pretty unbeatable.
